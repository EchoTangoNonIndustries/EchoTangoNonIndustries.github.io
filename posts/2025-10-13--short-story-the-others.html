<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    The boy wakes up in the dark, swallows some vitamins and instamash, and
    makes his checklist for the day ahead.
    (It's on paper for now - the electrolet broke.)
    He's trying to figure out how to repair this truck from ancient videos -
    it's a mix of parts, but it hasn't rusted into dust yet.
    Luckily the fuel hasn't run out, but if he made it electric,
    the solars could charge it while he's doing other things.

    His days usually consist of exercise when he's awake.
    Running on low to no sleep means he can't jog as often as he needs to.
    He'll have time to regret it later; He hasn't been hunted down in the night yet.
    He lifts weights when he can, plus sit-ups, medicine-ball, and chin-ups.
    He does squats with as heavy a dumbbell as possible -
    there's some broken shit he needs to haul out of his hidy-hole.

    Man, I really need to train this dog to not be scared of children.
    The young ones aren't big enough to hurt her, and
    she's fast enough to dodge the soccer-balls of the bigger ones.
    I mean, she's even frickin' scared of adults, if they walk funny.
    My insomnia's better than it used to be, but it's still not zero.
    Shit, I still need to build my own bed frame.
    I've got the saw-horses in the garage now, but
    I've still got half-painted lawn statuettes in the way.
    Oh man, I really need to ---
