<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    Night time fishing <br/>
    Best time for wishing <br/>
    Tastiest one to eat <br/>
    Has eight suckered feet <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Not much luck today <br/>
    Next time try the bay <br/>
    Skip a few stones <br/>
    Time to go home <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Dawn is time to sleep <br/>
    Curl up under a tree <br/>
    Troll's stony skin <br/>
    Helps him blend in <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight's a full moon <br/>
    With no clouds to occlude <br/>
    The moonlight helps to see <br/>
    Mushrooms under the trees <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Pick the right ones <br/>
    So you don't hurt your tums <br/>
    Mottled grey to swallow <br/>
    Reds and blacks for arrows <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Get bored of the sames <br/>
    This month try new plains <br/>
    Pack fishing pole and trinkets <br/>
    Hike and listen to crickets <br/>
</p>
<p>
    For a change of pace <br/>
    Vacation where they all race <br/>
    At the edge of the city <br/>
    Find a bridge that looks pretty <br/>
</p>
<p>
    After a night of exploring <br/>
    Head back to make snoring <br/>
    But ho, it's not vacant <br/>
    There's a lump under a tent! <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Glow-shroom shows a face <br/>
    Reading a book in this place <br/>
    A nice cloak of dark red <br/>
    Covers a new troll friend! <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Stay up chatting too late <br/>
    The sun's like a dinner plate! <br/>
    Curl up with a smile <br/>
    Troll will stay here a while <br/>
</p>
