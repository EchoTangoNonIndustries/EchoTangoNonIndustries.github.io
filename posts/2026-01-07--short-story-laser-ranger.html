<h1>A Beacon of Light</h1>
- laser-ranger wakes up in the post-apocalypse
- a few vignettes
- scavenge batteries
- Tough Choices TM for ammo vs other uses
- they're on a journey to The White Spire, for the Holy Fabricator
- end with them hitting the button, and a bright flash of light...

    Well, then. The world appears to be fucked, and
    this great pillar seems like an obvious destination.
    If it's filled with rich assholes and their security guards and murderbots,
    we fight our way in or die trying.
    Slowly starving to death out here doesn't seem like a great way to go out.
    Especially without anyone to talk to, or even just a box of movies and music and porn.

    Time to figure out what supplies I've got.
    My holster's beside the bed, and it's got fresh batteries and spares.
    I've got my backpack I use for going to work, or
    day-hikes on my days off.
    Clear out the bathroom - tampons, painkillers, pills for nausea, cold, cough...
    These adrenaline pens I kept for when my cousin Zez visited might be useful too.

    I was going to go camping next week with my ex and my cousin,
    so I've got a bunch of dried food ready to pack.
    Nuts and raisins, the fish jerky I wanted to try, instant noodles,
    plus a couple military rations - pork stew with biscuits, and
    chicken sausages with buckwheat and cranberry salad - sounds nice!
    I can usually fit my summer sleeping bag in here, but Zez always had the tent.
    Did I ever buy that emergency heat-tarp-tent thing...?
</p>
<p>
    OK, let's check this shelf - folding mini-stove, water filter,
    emergency radio, flame-lighters, flashlight-lighters...
    Right. I got started making a waterproof cloak-tarp.
    Well, I still have power and the supplies are still sitting in this box...
    Fuck, I still need water... ...
    I've got two liter-bottles, and three handies -
    that should be enough for a day and a half easily -
    it's pretty temperate in this...blackened void of a land.
    Not sure how the hell that works - without the sun, we should be freezing.
