<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    The boy wakes up in the dark, shovels some vitamins and instamash, and
    makes his checklist for the night ahead.
    (It's on paper for now - the electrolet broke.)
    He's trying to figure out how to repair this truck from ancient vids -
    it's a mix of parts, but it hasn't rusted into dust yet.
    Luckily the fuel hasn't run out, but if he made it electric,
    the solars could charge it while he's doing other things.
</p>
<p>
    His routine is scavenging, fixing, and exercise when he's awake.
    Running on low to no sleep means he can't jog as often as he needs to.
    He'll have time to regret it later;
    None of Them have hunted him down in the night yet.
    He lifts weights when he can, plus sit-ups, medicine-ball, and chin-ups.
    He does squats with as heavy a dumbbell as possible -
    there's some broken shit he needs to haul out of his hidy-hole.
</p>
<p>
    Several of Them are close to his hideout -
    he'll need to circle wide, to avoid them sniffing him out.
    His dog skitters - there's a few more he didn't notice.
    They're far enough - just keep the distance, and sneak out.
    He spies a nice vehicle - repaired with care and dedication.
    Take a few pics, and log the location for later.
</p>
<p>
    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a peep. <br/>
    Dog's curled up. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight he's scavenging food -
    peanut-butter and oats are long-lasting and pretty good.
    There's canned vegetables and meat which last even longer,
    so he'll grab some of those too.
    (The rest should still be here if things go even more to shit.)
    He's got a hand-cart with big wheels -
    it can handle broken pavement and dirt paths fairly well.
    Plus, it saves fuel and gets him exercise.
</p>
<p>
    He's growing vegetables, fruit bushes and trees, and getting better at it.
    He forgot to put up steel wire this spring,
    so a hare chewed on his youngest tree again now that it's fall.
    He finally got the tree wrapped and protected after this reminder,
    but it might still die after the winter.
    Trapping a hare would be good practice for getting local protein,
    especially since he's still a bad shot slinging spare ball-bearings.
</p>
<p>
    He's out on a hike, to get more supplies for his garden -
    there's a few buildings left with some intact seeds.
    He's almost at half-day, so it's time ot head back -
    on the way out the door, the fur on his dog back raises.
    It's good she's quiet while out on walks - just take a small detour.
    Another few on the way back give a wider detour, but he's back before night.
</p>
<p>
    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a peep. <br/>
    Dog's curled up. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    There's so many things to do when you're on your own.
    He's been too tired to reorganize his inventory -
    he found two extra hammers and three extra screwdrivers
    the last time he powered through a clean-up.
    (Those must have been grabbed in an insomnia-fueled daze.)
    At least the food stock's in check -
    it's easier to tidy things you use every day.
</p>
    Back to base. <br/>
    No more cheap. <br/>
    Dog's a vampire. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>
<p>
    He's still moving bricks, rock, and concrete around,
    so he can have a fire without attracting any of Them to his place.
    It'll be nice in the winter,
    to keep warm and get sunlight while his travel's limited by snow and ice.
    If he was bio-engineered to not go stir-crazy indoors and alone,
    it'd help out a lot.
    Then again, They're bad enough -
    he might not even exist if a super-virus had wiped everyone out.
</p>
<p>
    Zombie dog. <br/>
    Zombie man. <br/>
    Zombie dude. <br/>
    Zombie van. <br/>
    Zombies grab rad pills. <br/>
    Over these deadly hills.<br/>
    Pick a rifle, shoot your gun. <br/>
    No shoot out shining sun. <br/>
    Army guy headshots _you_. <br/>
    Now the army is zombie too. <br/>
    Zombie zombie in your head. <br/>
    Zombie zombie never dead. <br/>
    Zombie vampire, that's werewolf.<br/>
    Zombie gorilla, that's enough.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    He still needs to build a nest -
    so he won't wake up cooking.
    The winter heat works just fine.
    his water's sorted out too.
    There's so many ---
</p>
<p>
    OK, one last patrol before sleep.
    His dog's still not fully trained, and
    he doesn't want her to bring any of Them back to his location.
    Worse would be if she was killed -
    she's half of what's keeping him sane right now.
</p>
<p>
    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a -<br/>
    Man, I really need to train this dog to not be scared of children.
    The young ones aren't big enough to hurt her, and
    she's fast enough to dodge the soccer-balls of the bigger ones.
    I mean, she's even frickin' scared of adults, if they walk funny.
    My insomnia's better than it used to be, but it's still not zero.
    Shit, I still need to build my own bed frame.
    I've got the saw-horses in the garage now, but
    I've still got half-painted lawn statuettes in the way.
    Oh man, I really need to ---
