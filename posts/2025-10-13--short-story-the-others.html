<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    Squinting and muttering, the boy wakes up.
    He shovels some vitamins and instant coffee into his mouth, and
    tries to start his day.
    Make a checklist on paper - the electronic gadget broke.
    He's trying to figure out how to repair his truck from old videos.
    It's a mix of parts, but it still works.
    Luckily the fuel hasn't run out yet, but he wants to turn it electric next.
</p>
<p>
    His days usually consist of exercise when he's awake.
    Insomnia's a bitch, so he can't jog as often.
    He'll regret it later; Right now he hasn't been chased down in the night.
    Find an old gym and lift some dusty weights.
    Do some sit-ups and medicine-ball, and get better at chin-ups.
    Do squats with as heavy a dumbbell as possible -
    there's some broken shit he needs to haul out of his hidy-hole.

    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a peep. <br/>
    Dog's lying down. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>
