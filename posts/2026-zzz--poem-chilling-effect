<h1>Chilling Effect: A Poem by A Chokecherry-Eating Poetry-Man</h1>

<p>
    Doxes here, and lawsuits there,<br>
    Dangers on the internet everywhere.<br>
    AI tools make it easier,<br>
    Swatting has never been breasier.<br>
    You share less on these globe-reaching social nets -<br>
    That's a chilling effect.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Worried about mixing work and personal,<br>
    All these different socials to be configured, and<br>
    Re-configured again, every different way.<br>
    Gosh, that sounds like re-inventing wheels!<br>
    (You get what you pay for right?)<br>
    (Cough cough, with open-source you get what you, me, she, they, them, etc pay for.)<br>
    So easy to fuck up, when they make it this hard -<br>
    It's part of the chilling effect.<br>
