<h1>A Beacon of Light</h1>
- laser-ranger wakes up in the post-apocalypse
- a few vignettes
- scavenge batteries
- Tough Choices TM for ammo vs other uses
- they're on a journey to The White Spire, for the Holy Fabricator
- end with them hitting the button, and a bright flash of light...

<p>
    Well, then. The world appears to be fucked, and
    this great pillar seems like an obvious destination.
    If it's filled with rich assholes and their security guards and murderbots,
    we fight our way in or die trying.
    Slowly starving to death out here doesn't seem like a great way to go out.
    Especially without anyone to talk to, or even just a box of movies and music and porn.
</p>
<p>
    Time to figure out what supplies I've got.
    My holster's beside the bed, and it's got fresh batteries and spares.
    I've got my backpack I use for going to work, or
    day-hikes on my days off.
    Clear out the bathroom - tampons, painkillers, pills for nausea, cold, cough...
    These adrenaline pens I kept for when my cousin Zez visited might be useful too.
</p>
<p>
    I was going to go camping next week with my ex and my cousin,
    so I've got a bunch of dried food ready to pack.
    Nuts and raisins, the fish jerky I wanted to try, instant noodles,
    plus a couple military rations - pork stew with biscuits, and
    chicken sausages with buckwheat and cranberry salad - sounds nice!
    I can usually fit my summer sleeping bag in here, but Zez always had the tent.
    Did I ever buy that emergency heat-tarp-tent thing...?
</p>
<p>
    OK, let's check this shelf - folding mini-stove, water filter,
    emergency radio, flame-lighters, flashlight-lighters...
    Right. I got started making a waterproof cloak-tarp.
    Well, I still have power and the supplies are still sitting in this box...
    Fuck, I still need water... ...
    I've got two liter-bottles, and three handies -
    that should be enough for a day and a half easily -
    it's pretty temperate in this...blackened void of a land.
    Not sure how the hell that works - without the sun, we should be freezing.
</p>
<p>
    Welp...this is all bigger than I can fit in my pack, and
    I don't have any wheels either.
    I better check on the street - my truck better still be there.
    The power's out in the building, but this flashlight's good enough.
    Down three flights of stairs, and out the door -
    Well, I've got good news and bad news.
    The good news is my truck is still parked here.
    The bad news is some bastards smashed the windows and stripped it for parts.
    Not sure why they didn't steal the thing first -
    Maybe some kids smashed it when things first went to shit, and
    other goons stripped it later.
</p>
<p>
    That complicates things somewhat.
    There's a few other smashed cars, motorcycles,
    a van that was used for sleep before it was trashed...
    You're kidding me - the only thing nobody stole or wrecked...
    The teenager's motor-scooter they used to get to school and deliver pizzas.
    I guess it was too boring-looking and small to be noticed.
    The little cargo trailer behind it's still attached too.
