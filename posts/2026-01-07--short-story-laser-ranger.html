<h1>A Beacon of Light</h1>
- laser-ranger wakes up in the post-apocalypse
- a few vignettes
- scavenge batteries
- Tough Choices TM for ammo vs other uses
- they're on a journey to The White Spire, for the Holy Fabricator
- end with them hitting the button, and a bright flash of light...

    Well, then. The world appears to be fucked, and
    this great pillar seems like an obvious destination.
    If it's filled with rich assholes and their security guards and murderbots,
    we fight our way in or die trying.
    Slowly starving to death out here doesn't seem like a great way to go out.
    Especially without anyone to talk to, or even just a box of movies and music and porn.
