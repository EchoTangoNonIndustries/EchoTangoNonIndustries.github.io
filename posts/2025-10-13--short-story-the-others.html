<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    Squinting and muttering, the boy wakes up.
    He shovels some vitamins and instant coffee into his mouth, and
    tries to start his day.
    Make a checklist on paper - the electronic gadget broke.
    He's trying to figure out how to repair his truck from old videos.
    It's a mix of parts, but it still works.
    Luckily the fuel hasn't run out yet, but he wants to turn it electric next.
