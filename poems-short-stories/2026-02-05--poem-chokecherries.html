<h2>Poem: Chokecherries</h2>
<p>
    Dark purple berries,<br>
    The tastiest treat.<br>
    Ripe at the end of summer,
    With just enough sweet.
</p>
<p>
    They dry out your mouth,<br>
    But don't taste bitter.<br>
    They're sitting there to be picked -<br>
    Don't let them fall as litter!<br>
</p>
<p>
    A globule of taste,<br>
    But sometimes an invasive weed.<br>
    Don't forget in your haste -<br>
    Spit out those seeds!<br>
</p>
