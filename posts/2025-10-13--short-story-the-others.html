<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    The boy wakes up in the dark, swallows some vitamins and instamash, and
    makes his checklist for the day ahead.
    (It's on paper for now - the electrolet broke.)
    He's trying to figure out how to repair this truck from ancient videos -
    it's a mix of parts, but it hasn't rusted into dust yet.
    Luckily the fuel hasn't run out, but if he made it electric,
    the solars could charge it while he's doing other things.
</p>
<p>
    His days usually consist of exercise when he's awake.
    Running on low to no sleep means he can't jog as often as he needs to.
    He'll have time to regret it later; He hasn't been hunted down in the night yet.
    He lifts weights when he can, plus sit-ups, medicine-ball, and chin-ups.
    He does squats with as heavy a dumbbell as possible -
    there's some broken shit he needs to haul out of his hidy-hole.
</p>
<p>
    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a peep. <br/>
    Dog's curled up. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>

    Dog's curled up. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    There's so many things to do when you're on your own.
    He's been too tired to reorganize his inventory -
    he found two extra hammers and three extra screwdrivers
    the last time he powered through a clean-up.
    (Those must have been grabbed in an insomnia-fueled daze.)
    At least the food stock's in check -
    it's easier to tidy things you use every day.
</p>
<p>
    He's still moving bricks, rock, and concrete around,
    so he can have a fire with out attracting any of Them to his place.
    It'll be nice in the winter,
    to keep warm and get sunlight while his travel's limited by snow and ice.
    If he was bio-engineered to not go stir-crazy indoors and alone,
    it'd help out a lot.
    Then again, They're bad enough -
    he might not even exist if a super-virus had wiped everyone out.
</p>
<p>
    OK, one last patrol before sleep.
    His dog's still not fully trained, and
    he doesn't want her to bring any of Them back to his location.
    Worse would be if she was killed -
    she's half of what's keeping him sane right now.

    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a -<br/>
    Man, I really need to train this dog to not be scared of children.
    The young ones aren't big enough to hurt her, and
    she's fast enough to dodge the soccer-balls of the bigger ones.
    I mean, she's even frickin' scared of adults, if they walk funny.
    My insomnia's better than it used to be, but it's still not zero.
    Shit, I still need to build my own bed frame.
    I've got the saw-horses in the garage now, but
    I've still got half-painted lawn statuettes in the way.
    Oh man, I really need to ---
