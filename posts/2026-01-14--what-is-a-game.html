<h1>What is a Game?</h1>
<p>
    Would you like to play a game?<br>
    Sure! Which one?<br>
    How about Guitar Smith?<br>
    That's not a game.<br>
    It's a test of skill with a point score!<br>
    That's not a game!<br>
    It's basically Guitar Hero but meant for learning!<br>
    Fun is a game, learning is not!<br>
</p>
<p>
    What say you about creeping horror?<br>
    That's just fun with more steps!<br>
    Not the kind where you defeat the evil;<br>
    The ones where you barely escape, over and again,<br>
    And then at the end you die anyway.<br>
    That's just a misery simulator!<br>
</p>
<p>
    Not all games always have fun -<br>
    If you're playing soccer,<br>
    That's surely a game?<br>
    I agree - winning is fun!<br>
    So then losing is also fun!<br>
    Don't twist my words -<br>
    Losing is bad.<br>
    But the chance of winning is still a game to be had!<br>
</p>
<p>
    I feel like you're being pedantic -<br>
    A slot machine's a game for losing most frantic!<br>
    It's got winning and losing of various amounts.<br>
    That's barely a game, you fucking lout.<br>
</p>
<p>
    I don't think there's a need for vulgarity;<br>
    This discussion is fun in its peculiarity!<br>
    Now what about - hey, put down the drink.<br>
    The discussion is over if you cannot think.<br>
    Here, hand it over, let's pour it out.<br>
    Get out of here! They proceeded to shout.<br>
</p>
<p>
    So out I went, and into the truck.<br>
    Back home to think, wishing them luck.<br>
    Sketching out diagrams before lying in bed.<br>
    The extroverted guy is alone in his head.<br>
