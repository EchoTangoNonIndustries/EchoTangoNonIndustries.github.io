<h1>Short Story: The Others</h1>
<p>
    Squinting and muttering, the boy wakes up.
    He shovels some vitamins and instamash into his mouth, and
    makes his checklist for the day ahead.
    (It's on paper for now - the electrolet broke.)
    He's trying to figure out how to repair this truck from ancient videos -
    it's a mix of parts, but it hasn't rusted into dust yet.
    Luckily the fuel hasn't run out, but if he made it electric,
    the solars could charge it while he's doing other things.

    His days usually consist of exercise when he's awake.
    Running on low to no sleep means he can't jog as often as he needs to.
    He'll have time to regret it later; He hasn't been hunted down in the night yet.
    He lifts weights when he can, plus sit-ups, medicine-ball, and chin-ups.
    He does squats with as heavy a dumbbell as possible -
    there's some broken shit he needs to haul out of his hidy-hole.

    Back to base. <br/>
    Not a peep. <br/>
    Dog's curled up. <br/>
    Try to sleep. <br/>
