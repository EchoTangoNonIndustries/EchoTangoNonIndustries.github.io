Night time fishing
Best time for wishing
Tastiest one to eat
Has eight suckered feet

Not much luck today
Next time try the bay
Skip a few stones
Time to go home

Dawn is time to sleep
Curl up under a tree
Troll's stony skin
Helps him blend in

Tonight's a full moon
With no clouds to occlude
The moonlight helps to see
Mushrooms under the trees

Pick the right ones
So you don't hurt your tums
Mottled grey to swallow
Reds and blacks for arrows 

Get bored of the sames
This month try new plains
Pack fishing pole and trinkets
Hike and listen to crickets

For a change of pace
Vacation where they all race
At the edge of the city
Find a bridge that looks pretty

After a night of exploring
Head back to make snoring 
But ho, it's not vacant
There's a lump under a tent!

Glow-shroom shows a face
Reading a book in this place 
A nice cloak of dark red
Covers a new troll friend! 

Stay up chatting to late
The sun's like a dinner plate! 
Curl up with a smile
Troll will stay here a while
